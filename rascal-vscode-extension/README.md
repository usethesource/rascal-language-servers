# Rascal Metaprogramming Language and Language Workbench

Rascal MPL is a programming language specifically designed to analyze and manipulate code in
any data format or programming language. This means code generation, code analysis, code visualization,
anything that you can do to code and with code, Rascal is designed to make it easy.

In particular the creation of IDEs for new Programming Languages and Domain Specific Languages (DSLs)
is easy with Rascal. The Rascal VScode extension is a so-called Language Workbench.

Have a look here for more information:
   * http://www.rascal-mpl.org
   * http://www.usethesource.io

## Features

* R-LSP: IDE features for the Rascal metaprogramming language (parsing, syntax highlighting, type-checking, REPL terminal)
* P-LSP: "language parameterized" LSP server for languages expressed in Rascal. From a syntax definition you can start running your own LSP in vscode in a few steps.
* Rascal terminal: highly integrated terminal REPL that allows you to:
   * script and experiment with ad-hoc code analyses and visualizations
   * register new DSLs with VSCode using the P-LSP
   * experiment and test new DSL features

The Rascal VScode extension currently is bundled with the following libraries:
   * Rascal standard library
   * Rascal-LSP LanguageServer library
   * Java analysis library based on Eclipse JDT

## Requirements

* Installed JDK _11_
* However, the extension will propose to download the right JDK for you if you do not have it yet.

## Extension Settings

No settings so far.

## Known Issues

This extension is stabilizing, some stuff is still a bit slow, but people are using it in their production development environments. Your constructive feedback is much appreciated at <https://github.com/usethesource/rascal-language-servers/issues>.

**This extension works best with Java 11; but running it on Java 17 reportedly works as well**

The Rascal type-checker has a known issue that makes **new binary library code backward incompatible** after every release, always. This means that you
should update your dependency on the `rascal` project to at least 0.33.7 and maximally 0.33.8 in your own projects to avoid spurious error messages. For the
same reason you have to set your use of the `rascal-maven-plugin` to 0.22.1. Until
we release a fix for the type-checker, all rascal projects and library packages on http://www.rascal-mpl.org are released synchronously. Consequently, after you
installed an update, it is immediately necessary to bump your dependencies on `rascal` and `rascal-maven-plugin`.

For other things we are working on have a look here:

   * https://github.com/usethesource/rascal/issues ; on the Rascal language independent of the IDE

## Release Notes

### 0.11.0

* there is a new "Rascal Configuration" view that shows the resolved dependencies per project xml, and allows you to browse the rascal sources inside of those.
* the `summarizer` contribution for DSLs has been replaced by `analyzer` and `builder`. Please review your language setup and migrate to builders (only on save), and analyzer (every change in the IDE). We have tried to keep the behavior as close to the original summarizer, but it will not be triggered on-demand anymore.
* small improvements:
  * DSLs can now register multiple extensions for a single language
  * we check for common rascal project setup errors when starting a new REPL
  * automatic reloading of changes now also works for cross-project dependencies
  * We have a new and improved version of the rascal logo
  * downstream dependencies were updated to the latest version

### 0.10.2

* upgrading to rascal 0.34.1 to fix a regression in concrete syntax
* the REPL is marked as non-transient, until we can properly reconnect it after a reload of the window

### 0.10.1

* bugfix for preloaded parsers

### 0.10.0

* the automatic JVM downloader will now prompt you for updates if they are available
* Every REPL now gets named after the project they are connected to
* For deployed DSL extensions (via the npm published version of this plugin) we have a temporary interface to supply a preloaded parser
* We now automatically run our pre-release test on every PR/commit via VS Code extension tester
* upgraded to rascal 0.34.0:
  * various performance improvements that improve import time and memory pressure
  * removal of some unused resolvers (benchmark/testdata/test-modules/boot)
  * various small bug fixes
* bug fixes:
  * fixed a bug where changes in a pom.xml would only be visible after a VS Code restart. Now it only takes a restart of the REPL. (or re-trigger the type checker)
  * fixed a bug where we would register schema's that were already registered (zip error message in the debug console)

### 0.9.1

* Bugfix for working directory of REPLs

### 0.9.0

* Webviews opened from Rascal can now have a title and view column
* There is now a setting to influence how much memory a REPL gets allocated (`rascal.interpreter.maxHeapSize` & `rascal.interpreter.stackSize`).
* The Rascal REPL now has a icon (it requires a bugfix in vscode 1.80 to correctly show)
* upgraded to rascal 0.33.7:
  * Better support for ModuleParserStorage
  * Changes to support the new webview capabilities
  * Various bugfixes
* This release includes an "easter egg"; an experimental debugger for Rascal which is currently under test.

### 0.8.3

* upgraded to rascal 0.33.5:
  * Fixed a second bug aroung ModuleParserStorage
  * Preparing for debugger API
### 0.8.2

* Upgraded to rascal 0.33.3:
  * Fixed a bug around ModuleParserStorage (see `lang::rascal::grammar::storage::ModuleParserStorage`)
  * Bugfixes with the lib resolver
  * New feature: `IO::findResources` that replaces some functionality that people used the `lib://` scheme for.

### 0.8.1

* Bugfix release for regression in typechecker introduced in v0.8.0

### 0.8.0

* This release comes with rascal 0.32.0 which features:
   * In ParseTree, `storeParsers` and `loadParsers` offer a way to skip loading and executing a parser generator after deployment. Parsers can be stored in an opaque binary format that is very quickly loaded again and wrapped as a Rascal function with the same interface as what the `parsers` function generates.
   * The interpreter uses `ModuleName.parsers` to parse modules with concrete syntax for every module file `ModuleName.rsc` that is in the same jar file.
   * 8 to 12% improvement in generated parser efficiency
   * several issues with respect to URI syntax resolved
   * fixes for #1805, #1804 and #1793; related to the consistency of the documentation (broken links and broken code examples)
   * M3 now has a default `implicitDeclarations` set which programming languages can fill with entities that are defined by language but do not have a source position anywhere (not even in the standard library).
   * M3 now has "specifications" (read test functions) that check what it means for a typical abstract syntax tree to be correct and how correct M3 relations relate to one another. For example, in an M3 model something should not be used if it is not declared, unless there are compilation errors.
   * Project names in the `project://` scheme are now always to be lowercase letters, hyphens (`-`) or underscores (`_`), as in `|project://my-project-name/src/main/rascal|`
* This release is based on rascal-maven-plugin 0.19.2 and rascal-tutor 0.11.4, which come with:
   * API functions now have their signature first, before the other documentation sections are printed
   * API modules have a link to their github source pages
   * All packages must report their FUNDING sources now
   * All packages must report their CITATION preferences now
   * All packages must report their LICENSE now
   * All packages automatically report their dependencies now as sourced from pom.xml
   * All code examples, if tagged with `error`, must also throw an error.
   * Fixed all code examples that were falsely tagged with `error`
* Finally, these are the changes local to the rascal-language-servers and rascal-lsp projects:
   * PR #262 fixed three important issues with the LSP server interactions that had effect on the quality of the hover help and the references feature. In particular when more source files were involved (e.g. in the Rascal case) sometimes seemingly random results are shown, or none. This fix removes the root cause of the confusion and also rationalizes some code around the mapping from cursor locations to locations in the summaries.
   * util::LanguageServer is now minimally documented and will appear on rascal-mpl.shortly in the Packages section under the `rascal-mpl` package.
   * Checks in RASCAL.MF files have been extended and improved.
   * Loading of classes from dependent projects has improved in the VScode terminal and the language-parametrized LSP; there was a bug which caused arbitrary jar files to be loaded instead of the ones declared in the `pom.xml`. Usually the last dependency in the pom file "won". This also means that `lib://myDependency` would sometimes implicitly resolve to `lib://myLaterDependency` and throw IO exceptions and `exists` tests set to `false`.

### 0.7.0

* Fixes issues with IDEServices::registerDiagnostics where only the first error would be registered.
* Fixes issue with Rascal library loading where Rascal source files where loaded in a different order from the path than their accompanied .class files.
* util::Reflective::newRascalProject now guarantees syntax regex for project folders and project names.
* XML, HTML and JSON parsers now provide source origin location with every node.
* Improved support for Windows PATHs in dependency resolution code of Rascal
* Fixed UTF8 encoding issue in the Lucene library
* Documentation improvements
* Several minor issues.
* Added more validation features for RASCAL.MF files.

### 0.6.3

* bugfix for writes to VS Code virtual file systems initiated from rascal (only first 8KB of the write was correctly transferred)

### 0.6.2

* Bugfix for RASCAL.MF validator ([#225](https://github.com/usethesource/rascal/issues/225))

### 0.6.1

* bumped rascal to 0.28.3 for performance fixes around maven and various bugfixes
* typechecking with latest 0.14.6 version of rascal-maven-plugin (and using linked rascal-library) to avoid outdated typepal files
* now allowing jdk 17 as runtime, we'll still install 11 as default, but jdk 17 seems to work.
* Bugfix for automatic jdk downloader on aarch64 osx (Apple M1 for example)
* RASCAL.MF files are now checked for common errors and incorrect configurations

### 0.6.0

* bumped rascal to 0.28.0 for the addition of vis::Graphs and fixes in util::Sampling and vis::Charts.
* fixed issues with the IDEServices::edit function, in the VScode terminal context and VScode parameterized DSL LSP server context, with logical locations and locations with line/column information (both previously unsupported), for use in interactive visualizations (for example).
* allow vscode extensions to use rascal-vscode independently of installed rascal; this means DSL implementations can run their own native extension when they are finished being developed.
* as a result, rascal-vscode is now also an independent npm package.

### 0.5.6

* fixes [issue](https://github.com/usethesource/rascal/issues/203) which was caused by an issue in the rascal project.
* bumped rascal to 0.27.3 for the above fix.

### 0.5.5

This release is about including a new version of the rascal project, 0.27.2:

* fixes [issue](https://github.com/usethesource/rascal/issues/1719) with variable scope leakages for optimized visit statements
* adds util::Validator for validating complex untyped hierarchical structures (such as obtained from XML, JSON or YAML)
* added vis::Charts for eight basic chart types
* redesign of lang::json::IO with more natural mapping to JSON objects, but more precarious constraints for mapping back. See util::Validator for bridging the new gap if you have a complex ADT with lots of overloading and many constructors per type. The default mapping only supports simple enums and single constructors per ADT.

### 0.5.4

* fixes an issue with [unsetRec issue](https://github.com/usethesource/rascal/issues/1705).
### 0.5.2

* fixed efficiency issue in use of the `project:///` scheme for browsing file hierarchies, like for example in getASTs function for Java.

* Rascal DSLs do not get typepal on the PathConfig/evaluator search path by default. Only rascal & rascal-lsp.
* `unregisterLanguage` was added to clear all or parts of a language
* Rascal REPLs get a progressbar while starting. This provides more feedback that something is happening, especially until the  [performance regression on windows](https://github.com/usethesource/rascal-language-servers/issues/187) is fixed.

* Version bumps for typepal and rascal-core with improved typechecking efficiency.
* Better error reporting for the Rascal LSP server and the parameterized LSP server.
* Fixes around status progress bars.
* Fix for packaging of rascal-lsp jar (which helped remove spurious type-checking errors in clients of the LanguageServer library modules)

### 0.2.0
