The ((registerLanguage)) function takes this as its parameter to generate and run

Each LanguageService provides one aspect of definining the language server protocol.
* a `parser` maps source code to a parse tree and indexes each part based on offset and length
* a `summarizer` indexes a file as a ((Summary)), offering precomputed relations for looking up
documentation, definitions, references, implementations and compiler errors and warnings.
* a `outliner` maps a source file to a pretty hierarchy for visualization in the "outline" view
* a `lenses` discovers places to add "lenses" (little views embedded in the editor) and connects commands to execute to each lense
* an `inlayHinter` is like lenses but inbetween words
* a `executor` executes the commands registered by `lenses` and `inlayHinters`
* a `documenter` is a fast and location specific version of the `documentation` relation in a ((Summary)).
* a `definer` is a fast and location specific version of the `definitions` relation in a ((Summary)).
* a `referrer` is a fast and location specific version of the `references` relation in a ((Summary)).
* an `implementer` is a fast and location specific version of the `implementations` relation in a ((Summary)).

@synopsis{Generates and instantiates a new language server for the given language}
@description{
We register languages by uploading the meta-data of the implementation to a "lanuage-parametric" language server.
1. The meta-data is used to instantiate a fresh run-time to execute the main-module.
2. The extension is registered with the IDE to link to this new runtime.
3. Each specific extension is mapped to a specific part of the language server protocol.

By registering a language twice, more things can happen:
* existing contributions are re-loaded and overwritten with the newest version.
* new contributions to an existing language (`Language` constructor instance), will be added to the existing LSP server instance. You can use this to load expensive features later or more lazily.
* errors appear during loading or first execution of the contribution. The specific contribution is then usually aborted and unregistered.

Because registerLanguage has effect in a different OS process, errors and warnings are not printed in the calling execution context.
In general look at the "Parametric Rascal Language Server" log tab in the IDE to see what is going on.

However since language contributions are just Rascal functions, it is advised to simply test them first right there in the terminal.
Use `util::Reflective::getProjectPathConfig` for a representative configuration.
