@description{
Summarizers provide information about the declarations and uses in the current file
which can be used to populate the information needed to implement interactive IDE
features.

There are two places a Summarizer can be called:
* Summarizers can be called after _file save_, in this case we use ((builder))s. Builders typically also have side-effects on disk (leaving generated code or API descriptions in the target folder), and they may run whole-program analysis and compilation steps.
* Or they can be called while typing, in this case we use ((analyzer))s. Analyzers typically use stored or cached information from other files, but focus their own analysis on their own file. Analyzers may use incremental techniques.

A summarizer provides the same information as the following contributors combined:
* ((documenter))
* ((definer))
* ((referrer))
* ((implementer))

The difference is that these contributions are executed on-demand (pulled), while Summarizers
are executed after build or after typing (push).

@description{
Each LanguageService provides one aspect of definining the language server protocol.
* ((parser)) maps source code to a parse tree and indexes each part based on offset and length
* ((analyzer)) indexes a file as a ((Summary)), offering precomputed relations for looking up
documentation, definitions, references, implementations and compiler errors and warnings.
   * ((analyzer))s focus on their own file, but may reuse cached or stored indices from other files.
   * ((analyzer))s have to be quick since they run in an interactive editor setting.
   * ((analyzer))s may store previous results (in memory) for incremental updates.
   * ((analyzer))s are triggered during typing, in a short typing pause.
* ((builder)) is similar to an `analyzer`, but it may perform computation-heavier additional checks.
   * ((builder))s typically run whole-program analyses and compilation steps.
   * ((builder))s have side-effects, they store generated code or code indices for future usage by the next build step, or by the next analysis step.
   * ((builder))s are triggered on _save-file_ events; they _push_ information to an internal cache.
   * Warning: ((builder))s are _not_ triggered when a file changes on disk outside of VS Code; instead, this results in a change event (not a save event), which triggers the ((analyzer)).
* the following contributions are _on-demand_ (pull) versions of information also provided by the analyzer and builder summaries.
   * a ((documenter)) is a fast and location specific version of the `documentation` relation in a ((Summary)).
   * a ((definer)) is a fast and location specific version of the `definitions` relation in a ((Summary)).
   * a ((referrer)) is a fast and location specific version of the `references` relation in a ((Summary)).
   * an ((implementer)) is a fast and location specific version of the `implementations` relation in a ((Summary)).
* ((outliner)) maps a source file to a pretty hierarchy for visualization in the "outline" view
* ((lenses)) discovers places to add "lenses" (little views embedded in the editor on a separate line) and connects commands to execute to each lense
* ((inlayHinter)) discovers plances to add "inlays" (little views embedded in the editor on the same line). Unlike ((lenses)) inlays do not offer command execution.
* ((executor)) executes the commands registered by ((lenses)) and ((inlayHinter))s

@synopsis{A Command is a parameter to a CommandExecutor function.}
@description{
Commands can be any closed term a() pure value without open variables or function/closure values embedded in it). Add any constructor you need to express the execution parameters
of a command.

You write the ((CommandExecutor)) to interpret each kind of ((util::LanguageServer::Command)) individually.
A ((Command) constructor must have fields or keyword fields that hold the parameters of the
to-be-executed command. 

Commands are produced for delayed and optional execution by:
* ((LensDetector)), where the will be executed if the lens is selected in the editor 
* ((CodeActionContributor)), where they will appear in context-menus for quick-fix and refactoring
* ((Message)), where they will appear in context-menus on lines with error or warning diagnostics

See also ((CodeAction)); a wrapper for ((util::LanguageServer::Command)) for fine-tuning UI interactions.
}
@examples{
```rascal
// here we invent a new command name `showFlowDiagram` which is parametrized by a loc:
data Command = showFlowDiagram(loc src);

value evaluator(showFlowDiagram(loc src)) {
    showInteractiveContent(flowDiagram(src));
    return true;
}
```
}
@pitfalls{
* Sometimes a command must be wrapped in a ((CodeAction)) to make it effective (see ((CodeActionContributor)) and ((Message)) )
* the `noop()` command will always be ignored.
* _never_ add first-class functions or closures as a parameter or keyword field to a `Command`. The Command will
be serialized, sent to the LSP client, and then sent back to the LSP server for execution. Functions can not be
serialized, so that would lead to run-time errors.

@synopsis{Code actions encapsulate computed effects on source code like quick-fixes, refactorings or visualizations.}
@description{
Code actions are an intermediate representation of what is about to happen to the source code that is loaded in the IDE,
or even in a live editor. They communicate what can (possibly) be done to improve the user's code, who might choose one of the options
from a list, or even look at different outcomes ahead-of-time in a preview.

The `edits` and `command` parameters are both optional, and can be provided at the same time as well.

If ((DocumentEdit))[edits] are provided then:
1. edits can be used for preview of a quick-fix of refactoring
2. edits are always applied first before any `command` is executed.
3. edits can always be undone via the undo command of the IDE

If a ((util::LanguageServer::Command))[command] is provided, then:
1. The title of the command is shown to the user
2. The user picks this code action (from a list or pressed "OK" in a dialog)
3. Any `edits` (see above) are applied first
4. The command is executed on the server side via the ((CommandExecutor)) contribution
   * Many commands use ((util::IDEServices::applyDocumentsEdits)) to provide additional changes to the input
   * Other commands might use ((util::IDEServices::showInteractiveContent)) to start a linked webview inside of the IDE
   * Also ((util::IDEServices::registerDiagnostics)) is a typical effect of a ((CodeAction)) ((util::LanguageServer::Command)).
5. The effects of commands can be undone if they where ((DocumentEdit))s, but other effects like diagnostics and
interactive content have to be cleaned or closed in their own respective fashions.
}
@benefits{
* CodeActions provide tight integration with the user experience in the IDE. Including sometimes previews, and always the undo stack.
* CodeActions can be implemented "on the language level", abstracting from UI and scheduling details. See also ((analysis::diff::edits)) for 
tools that can produce lists of ((DocumentEdit))s by diffing parse trees or abstract syntax trees.
* `edits` are applied on the latest editor content for the current editor; live to the user.
* ((util::IDEServices::applyDocumentsEdits)) also works on open editor contents for the current editor.
* The parse tree for the current file is synchronized with the call to a ((CodeActionContributor)) such that edits
and input are computed in-sync.
}
@pitfalls{

or may not work on the current editor contents. If you want to be safe it's best to only edit the current file.

@synopsis{Generates and instantiates a new language server for the given language}
@description{
We register languages by uploading the meta-data of the implementation to a "lanuage-parametric" language server.
1. The meta-data is used to instantiate a fresh run-time to execute the main-module.
2. The extension is registered with the IDE to link to this new runtime.
3. Each specific extension is mapped to a specific part of the language server protocol.

By registering a language twice, more things can happen:
* existing contributions are re-loaded and overwritten with the newest version.
* new contributions to an existing language (`Language` constructor instance), will be added to the existing LSP server instance. You can use this to load expensive features later or more lazily.
* errors appear during loading or first execution of the contribution. The specific contribution is then usually aborted and unregistered.

Because registerLanguage has effect in a different OS process, errors and warnings are not printed in the calling execution context.
In general look at the "Parametric Rascal Language Server" log tab in the IDE to see what is going on.

However since language contributions are just Rascal functions, it is advised to simply test them first right there in the terminal.
Use `util::Reflective::getProjectPathConfig` for a representative configuration.
